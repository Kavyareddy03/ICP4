in Question1,  We are loading and preprocessing the Breast Cancer dataset, includes normalizing the features and splitting the data into training and testing sets. Then we are building a neural network model with three hidden layers and a final output layer for binary classification. And then compile the model with binary crossentropy loss and Adam optimizer, and train it for 100 epochs. After training, we print the model's summary and evaluates its performance on the test set, displaying the test accuracy.
In Question2, we are loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset, in which we are normalizing the image data and one-hot encoding the labels. Then defining, compiling, and training a neural network with two hidden layers and a softmax output layer, we track the training and validation accuracy and loss. After training, we predict and display the class of a sample image, and finally, we build and train an alternative model with a different activation function for comparison..
